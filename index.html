    <h4> Natalie Brainin said she knew from her first year at UCLA that she wanted to perform as a soloist in Spring Sing. </h4>

    <p>The third-year ethnomusicology student and singer-songwriter performed in last year’s Spring Sing as part of two different production groups – her sorority, Delta Gamma, and Resonance A Capella. But this time, Brainin will take the stage alone with her keyboard.</p>

    <p>Brainin will perform “Forever,” an original song she wrote earlier this year to preach self-love.</p>

    <p>“One of the main messages I wanted to portray with the song is that you need to love yourself before you can love someone else,” Brainin said. “The only love that will really last forever is you loving yourself.”</p>

    <p>Inspired by anything, ranging from her dreams to poems, Brainin said she practices every day in her apartment and strives to write a new song every month.</p>

    <p>“(Playing music) is definitely a constant thing in my life,” Brainin said. “It doesn’t feel like something I have to think about. It’s something I want to do.”</p>

    <p>Even though Brainin’s primary instrument of choice is the piano, she can also play the guitar. She said that by playing music, she is able to compose more.</p>

    <p>“I’ll find a cool chord progression through practicing another chord progression and usually I’ll link that to an idea and I’ll have lyrics accompany it so I know exactly what to do with it,” Brainin said. “It really just depends on what I’m doing and what’s happening in my life.”</p>

    <p>Although she said her music is acoustic alternative, Brainin said her songs are also influenced by pop and jazz, the latter of which comes from a jazz combo course Brainin took at UCLA this past year. Ultimately, Brainin said her music is reflective of the singer-songwriter genre and tries to keep her music at a more coffee shop vibe.</p>

    <p>Last year, the singer performed twice, once with Delta Gamma and once with Resonance A Capella. However, Brainin said she has always wanted to perform solo.</p>

    <p>“It was my goal when I was a freshman,” Brainin said. “I really wanted to get into Spring Sing and even if I didn’t get in, I knew I was going to try at least for all four years.”</p>

    <p>Working alone, Brainin said she misses the fun social aspect of performing with a group and said the process of going solo is different.<p>

    <p>“It’s been interesting in the sense that I make all the decisions and feel that independence – just believing in myself and knowing that I’m capable to run my own act,” Brainin said. “I think this is a much more self-reflective process, and I think it will be really rewarding because it has been so far.”</p>


    <p>Brainin said Spring Sing will be the largest audience she will have performed in front of. The singer said she is hoping people get something out of her performance that they can personally and emotionally connect with.</p>


    <p>“They can expect a really honest performance about something that I feel passionate about,” Brainin said. “I’m hoping to touch some people’s hearts with it.”</p>

    <h4>With three Spring Sings already under his belt and a UCLA degree imminent, fourth-year cognitive science student Nick Valentini is in the midst of working towards the future. But Valentini said his life is all about the present and a bit about the past.</h4>

    <p>“You listen to my first Spring Sing and I’m rapping in it,” Valentini said. “The song I’m doing now is light-years different. The four years have been this evolutionary change, but also something that can be predicted by the people that know me.”</p>

    <p>Valentini describes that song, “Mr. Mister,” as a tune which he wrote with a band in mind. He will be performing twice at Spring Sing, including once with his band Loop Garou. But for his act as a solo keyboardist, Valentini said he will be going darker in tone.</p>

    <p>“It definitely isn’t a ballad,” Valentini said. “It’s not just saying, ‘I love you, I love you,’ – I have a lot of songs like that too – but for this stage and this time in my life, I thought it would be cool not to just sing about that one girl.”</p>

    <p>Valentini said that, though he has no concrete plans in the long run, he doesn’t see himself forever working as a solo act. In terms of music, he values collaboration with others above all else.</p>

    <p>Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly,” for example, is a work that Valentini said is an example of producing an actual difference in the genre. Through working with the best musicians possible, he cites Lamar’s social implications as a perfect way to utilize talent.</p>

    <p>“With music, it’s just continual gigging, playing, networking and connecting with everyone,” Valentini said. “That’s the one thing: you play with everyone because you learn from everyone. One day down the line they might say, ‘Come play with me again.’”</p>

    <p>For Valentini, one of those people is David Villafaña, an alumnus who plays in UCLA band We the Folk. Villafaña said that, in their weekly gigs, Valentini likes to take a sincere approach to reinventing songs and taking risks.</p>

    <p>“(Valentini) can easily please a crowd, but he also likes to be dynamic,” Villafaña said. “There are songs that I have that are in Spanish with a very Latin sound, and he’ll improvise and do a good job.”</p>

    <p>Valentini said most of his inspiration comes from other instrumentalists who know how to jam – two of his favorite solo acts are Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimi Hendrix. He said that if he could make “Mr. Mister” a seven-minute performance similar to Vaughan and Hendrix's work, he would.</p>

    <p>“I guess if I went on stage and did that, they couldn’t stop me,” Valentini said.</p>

    <p>Villafaña said that since he and Valentini don’t rehearse together, rocking out is an essential part of Valentini’s repertoire. He commends Valentini’s ability to challenge himself and the listener with his music and mood, but also to assert himself and get things done.</p>

    <p>But for now, Valentini also said he’s really stoked for Spring Sing, where he will open the ceremony with a keyboard drop in front of 9,000 students.</p>

    <p>“You continue to gig and hand out your cards and float your name around there, but you have to give time to this creative output,” Valentini said. “The future is unknown musically, but that’s where hard work comes in.”</p>

    <h4>Lashon Halley found out she was performing at Spring Sing, called her friend Xiomara Fambrough and said, “Yo Xi, I got in with the song I wrote for you.”</h4>

    <p>A year ago, Halley wrote the song “Done with You” for Fambrough, who was having problems with her boyfriend.</p>

    <p>"She didn’t (write) it for her own benefit," Fambrough said. "She wrote it so that when she sang it out loud, it made me realize the decision I made was the right one."</p>

    <p>Halley, a third-year art history student, will perform her original song at Spring Sing while playing an acoustic-electric guitar. Some of the bass singer’s songs are R&B, though most are mellow background music; she said “Done with You” is similar to the latter – soothing with a powerful ending.</p>

    <p>Singing since a young age, Halley said she later joined a band with her two best friends as a sophomore in high school and began experimenting with her songwriting.</p> 

    <p>"I go on a lot of dates with people to get material, so all my songs are about people that I know personally,” Halley said.</p>

    <p>Before transferring to UCLA, Halley attended Santa Barbara City College, where she said vocal technique classes helped her discover her voice, opening her eyes to her range and belt. Halley said her music instructor, Nathan Kreitzer, a music assistant professor at the community college, challenged her with a high-pitched song and told her she couldn’t lower the octave but had to sing in the original pitch.</p>

    <p>Fambrough said she met Halley in Kreitzer's class. She cried the first time she heard Halley perform "Done with You," because she said it's a beautiful and empathetic piece, but also a sad one.</p>

    <p>“It made me realize how amazing she can be as songwriter because she’s never had those emotions herself,” Fambrough said.</p>

    <p>In addition to her solo act, Halley will sing as a member of Signature A Cappella. Lauren Blenkinship, a first-year psychology student and member of Signature, said she has grown close to Halley this year and said she was impressed with Halley's distinct, standout voice, which epitomizes the emotion of her solos.</p>

    <p>Halley said she has been performing at music stores, bars and open-mic events for the past few years – ultimately hoping to sing professionally. She said she now creates music in her bedroom, shutting the door and closing the window to be alone with her guitar.</p>

    <p>“I have my computer open and just type the words, because I can’t write quick enough for the ideas,” Halley said.</p>

    <p>To celebrate her upcoming performance, Halley said her grandparents let her pick out a new guitar as her accompaniment at Spring Sing.</p>

    <p>"The tone of the guitar is warm, the same warmth of my voice, so I was like, 'These match perfectly,'" Halley said. "And I just knew right away.”</p>
